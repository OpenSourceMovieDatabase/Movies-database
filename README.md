# Movies-database
Open source movies information database, API and always free ( unlike other people going from open source to commercial api's)

## Still under development ( should be available pretty soon)

## Proposed API

```
/api?movie=batman // returns all movies with name batman
/api?movie=batman&year=2015 // returns all movies with batman and year 2015
/api?actor=leonardo%20decaprio // returns all movies by leonardo decaprio
```

Node module based movie database for API's. since source files are available you could use it any framework.
